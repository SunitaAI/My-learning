Stay curious my friends - Art of communication

The true essence of communication lies in the art of listening rather than merely speaking. However, in today's world, the balance seems to have shifted, depriving many hearts of the opportunity to express themselves. Developing the skill of being a proficient listener requires spiritual maturity. It is often said that empty vessels make the most noise, and similarly, constant self-expression often leaves us oblivious to understanding others and the world around us.

The key to connecting with others lies in creating an environment where they feel comfortable opening their hearts to us. This process demands stability and patience, reflecting the tranquility within an individual. Spiritual luminaries have long practiced the art of maintaining silence in their communication, recognizing that when they do speak, their words hold profound significance in spiritual life. The science of listening and the art of thoughtful speaking are the foundations of effective communication.

Misunderstandings and judgments often arise from broken communication channels. Fortunately, practical exercises can help improve these channels and establish a solid foundation for effective communication. Cultivating inquisitiveness allows individuals to learn about others and, in turn, helps us become better individuals ourselves. Once this journey of understanding others begins, expressing ourselves authentically becomes essential. The most valuable advice is not merely recited from a book but rather derived from lived experiences. Integrating one's words with actions reinforces the power of our sermons and advice.
